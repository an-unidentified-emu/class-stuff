== Introduction
Friction is a force encountered in almost all physics experiments. It is a "force that resists the sliding or rolling of one solid object over another" [1]. Friction is a macroscopic summation of many microscopic forces acting between two surfaces. Friction is proportional to the normal force on an object and can be expressed as $f = mu F_N$ where $f$ is the force of friction, $F_N$ is the normal force and $mu$ is the _coefficient of friction_. The purpose of this lab is to find the coefficient of friction between two pieces of wood.

== Methods
Accepted theory states that there are two different coefficients of friction, one for static friction, $f_s = mu_s F_N$ and one for kinetic friction $f_k = mu_k F_N$
